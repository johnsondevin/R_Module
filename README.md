# R_Sprint_Module
# Overview

As a busy student, I have found that my time is very precious and expensive. Once I use it, I don't have that time back. I have chosen to use a portion of my time to further learn and develop my programming ability by taking this class and by pushing myself to learn new languages and methods to use with familiar languages.

This program is a simple program that computes some statical data from the entered data.

I wrote this software to learn the R programming language and to obtain a base understanding of how data science is achieved and conducted.

# Development Environment

To create this program, I used the R programming language along with the Visual Studio Code IDE.

R is an open-source language free for public use. It is the most used language in statistical analysis and data science. Used by many cutting-edge companies, R enables people to program, analyze, and show the results of the data set.

# Future Work

- I want to enhance my ability to use this language efficiently to covey data analysis in an appealing manner.
- In the future, I would like to add to this project some other functions to manipulate the CSV data.
- Something that I want to improve is my ablility to comunicate with others. Communication could lead to more thoughtful solutions and more efficient code.
